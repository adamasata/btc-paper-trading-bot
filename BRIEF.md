# Take-Home: Build a Bitcoin Trading Bot

Build a paper-trading bot for Bitcoin, with a strategy of your own, that is profitable over the last 24 hours. Take at most 4 hours. When you send it, we'll rerun it on the latest 24 hours and it must still be profitable.

## The task

Write a bot that replays the last 24 hours of BTC/USD prices and trades them with your strategy, as if it had been running live. No real money: it starts with 10,000 USD of paper money. Any language, any AI tools.

## Rules

- **Profitable:** it ends the 24 hours with more than 10,000 USD, after fees.
- **At least 5 trades:** a trade is a buy and the sell that closes it.
- **Flat at the end:** it holds 0 BTC when the 24 hours end. Everything it buys, it sells inside the window.
- **Fees:** 0.1% on every buy and every sell.
- **Long only:** no leverage, no shorting.
- **No look-ahead:** each decision uses only prices up to that moment.
- **Real data:** the bot fetches prices itself from a free public feed (for example Binance or Coinbase public candles), with no API keys. Candle size is your choice.
- **Rerunnable:** one command, no edits between runs. The window is always the 24 hours before the moment it runs.
- **Time box:** 4 hours of hands-on time.

## What the bot prints

- Every trade: buy time and price, sell time and price, size, fees, profit or loss.
- Totals: number of trades, final balance, profit in USD and %, and buy-and-hold over the same 24 hours for comparison.

## What to send back

Within 3 days:

1. **Repo link** with the full commit history.
2. **A way for us to run it**, either:
   - a hosted link where we press one button and see the results for the latest 24 hours, or
   - setup steps plus one command that work on a clean Mac from a fresh clone. Test this yourself, and name any prerequisites (e.g. Python 3.12, Node 20 or Docker).
3. **A short README:**
   - the strategy in a few sentences: when it buys, when it sells, and why
   - how you came up with it, and what you tried that didn't work
   - the output of your own run, with its date and time
   - which AI tools you used
4. **A 5-minute Loom** explaining the strategy: the core idea, how you got to it, and why you expect it to keep working.

## How we'll judge it

1. **The rerun:** we run it as-is on the latest 24 hours. It must be profitable after fees, make at least 5 trades and end flat.
2. **The strategy:** from your README and Loom, a clear core idea, how you got to it, and why it should work beyond the day you tested it.
